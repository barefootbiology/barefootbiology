Hello. I'm S. Scott Whitmore (@barefootbiology), an assistant research scientist at [The University of Iowa Institute for Vision Research](https://ivr.uiowa.edu/). I co-lead the Retinal Imaging and Modeling Laboratory (www.rimlab.org). My interests include computational and statistical models of retinal degeneration, molecular genetics of inherited eye diseases, natural history, science education and public outreach.

I program in R and dabble in JavaScript.
